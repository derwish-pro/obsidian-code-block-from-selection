# Code block from selection

This plugin adds a "Code block from selection" command (Ctrl+\` ) that turns the selected text into a code block. It just adds \`\`\` before and after the selected text. In the plugin settings you can specify which language to use in the code block.

# How to use

Just select the text with code or put the cursor on the desired line and press Ctrl+\`.
